Created UserController.cs in Controllers folder.
Followed this tutorial for the changes listed below. https://rb.gy/dqecqq
The UserController constructor assigns the AppDbContext reference to a private field _context.
Added GetUsers() and GetusersById() methods with the [HttpGet] attribute.
GetUsers() saves all the users as a c sharp list.
GetUserById() uses the function Find() to find the user searching by id.
The function Find() is a better option for searching a table, as stated by the tutorial.
The [FromRoute] attribute in ASP.NET Core is used to explicitly specify that a parameter should be populated from the route data in the URL.
